## 📖 Overview
- Many students feel stressed or isolated between counselling sessions and need simple, private ways to reflect and stay encouraged.
- University students seeking mental health support tools that are safe, personal, and complementary to existing campus services.
- Instead of a standard diary, the app delivers time-capsule encouragement: messages from your past self and supportive peer notes.
- This creates a unique cycle of reflection, self-compassion, and community connection that strengthens existing mental health support systems.
  
## ⚙️ Features
